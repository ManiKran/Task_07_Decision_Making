The Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse team had a mixed 2025 season, finishing 10-9 overall. The team’s offense was strong, averaging 12.3 goals per game compared to opponents’ 11.6. Shot accuracy was high at 43.7%, and the squad excelled in clear percentage at over 90%. However, draw controls were an area of weakness, with Syracuse trailing opponents 240 to 280. 

Performance by period shows a gradual decline in offensive output: 74 goals in the first period fell to only 47 in the fourth. This suggests fatigue or late-game strategy issues. Defensively, the team allowed more goals in the fourth period (59) than in any other quarter. Goalkeeper save percentage was relatively low (43%), compared to opponents (41%), indicating room for improvement.

Recommendations include: (1) improving stamina training to maintain offensive pressure late in games, (2) addressing draw control strategy to secure more possessions, and (3) considering specialized goalie training to raise save percentage. With these adjustments, Syracuse could turn close losses into wins and improve overall consistency.
